## Codebase Patterns
- SDK-facing auth endpoints should validate X-API-Key via ApiKeyService to resolve the Project context.
- Password policy for end-user flows is derived from ProjectSettings (min length, uppercase, numbers, special chars).
- End-user login lockouts use ProjectSettings failedLoginMaxAttempts/failedLoginWindowSeconds and EndUser failedLogin fields.
- End-user JWTs are authenticated via EndUserPrincipal from JwtAuthenticationFilter; use @AuthenticationPrincipal EndUserPrincipal for SDK auth endpoints.
- Refresh token rotation should lock the refresh token row to prevent concurrent reuse.
- End-user password reset tokens are stored hashed with 1-hour expiry and a used_at marker for single-use enforcement.
- Password history enforcement should use ProjectSettings.passwordHistoryCount; treat <=0 as default 5 and compare via PasswordEncoder.matches.
- For end-user password changes that keep the current session, accept `X-Session-Id` (end-user access JWTs don't carry session ids); if selecting a "current" session/token from the DB, use `@Lock(PESSIMISTIC_WRITE)` to avoid races.
- End-user email verification tokens are stored hashed with 24-hour expiry and a used_at marker; resends mark existing tokens used.
- Gateway SDK routes resolve API keys via /internal/api-keys/resolve and forward X-Project-Id.
- Maven modules live under `backend/`; run per-service tests from there (e.g. `mvn -pl services/auth-service test`).
- Auth-service repository tests rely on Hibernate DDL from entity mappings (keep Flyway migrations and JPA entities in sync).
- Domain events from auth-service use DomainEventPublisher; RabbitMQ publishes JSON to the default exchange with routing key = event type (disable in tests via `auctoritas.messaging.rabbit.enabled=false` and `spring.rabbitmq.dynamic=false`).
- For structured service logs, prefer `StructuredArguments.kv(...)` so LogstashEncoder emits searchable JSON fields; correlation id is carried via MDC key `correlationId`.
- In JPA tests, if you `entityManager.clear()`, re-fetch entities (find/getReference) before persisting new rows with @ManyToOne relations.

- Added project-scoped email verification token persistence via the new `email_verification_tokens` table and aligned JPA mappings.
- Files changed: backend/services/auth-service/src/main/resources/db/migration/V15__email_verification_tokens.sql, backend/services/auth-service/src/main/java/dev/auctoritas/auth/entity/enduser/EndUserEmailVerificationToken.java, backend/services/auth-service/src/main/java/dev/auctoritas/auth/service/EndUserEmailVerificationService.java, prd.json, progress.txt
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Patterns discovered: If a token must be project-scoped, persist `project_id` explicitly (don't rely on joining through user) and validate it against the API key's project.
  - Gotchas encountered: Auth-service tests run with Flyway disabled and rely on Hibernate DDL; keep entity mappings consistent with new migrations.
  - Useful context: Email verification uses TokenService SHA-256 (Base64url) hashes; raw token/code never touch the DB and codes expire after 24h.
