2026-01-24: Implemented US-002 org member login with JWT; added OrgAuthController, OrgAuthService, LoginRateLimitFilter (5 attempts/15min per IP); validates email verified status and returns tokens on success.
2026-01-24: Implemented US-003 refresh token rotation; added OrgMemberRefreshToken entity, repository, V3 migration; POST /api/v1/org/auth/refresh endpoint rotates tokens (revokes old, issues new); rejects expired/revoked tokens with error codes (refresh_token_expired, refresh_token_revoked, invalid_refresh_token).
2026-01-24: Implemented US-004 JWT protection for org endpoints; added JwtService (HMAC signing), JwtAuthenticationFilter, OrgMemberPrincipal, SecurityFilterChain; JWT contains org_member_id, org_id, email, role claims; public endpoints (/register, /auth/login, /auth/refresh, /actuator/health) permitted; all other /api/v1/org/** routes require valid JWT.
